# LeetCode

This is a repo of solutions to LeetCode problems in preparation for job interviews. I summed up some of the problems and a few special topics that I found hard to tackle or inspiring.

The main programming lanaguage I used is C++. I also used Java for some of the problems.

## Topics

### Data Structures and Algorithms

* [Bit Manipulation](Topics/Bit%20Manipulation.md)

* [Disjoint Set (Union-Find)](Topics/Disjoint%20Set.md)

* [Linked List](Topics/Linked%20List.md)

* [Trie (Prefix Tree)](Topics/Trie.md)

### Langauge-specific Practices
