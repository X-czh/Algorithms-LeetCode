# Algorithms-LeetCode

This started as a repo of solutions to LeetCode problems in preparation for job interviews. I summed up some of the problems and a few special topics that I found hard to tackle or inspiring. Over time, it has evolved into a collection of algorithms notes backed up with solutions to LeetCode problems as examples.

The main programming lanaguage I used is C++. I also used Java for some of the problems.
