# Dynamic Programming

## Introduction

(Adapted from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming#Computer_programming))

Dynamic Programming is nothing more than *smart recursion*, or in other words, *recursion without repetition*. There are two key attributes that a problem must have in order for dynamic programming to be applicable: **optimal substructure** and **overlapping sub-problems**. If a problem can be solved by combining optimal solutions to non-overlapping sub-problems, the strategy is called "divide and conquer" instead.

**Optimal substructure** means that the solution to a given optimization problem can be obtained by the combination of optimal solutions to its sub-problems. Such optimal substructures are usually described by means of recursion.

**Overlapping sub-problems** means that the space of sub-problems must be small, that is, any recursive algorithm solving the problem should solve the same sub-problems over and over, rather than generating new sub-problems. Dynamic programming takes account of this fact and solves each sub-problem only once by storing the solutions of intermediate subproblems.

This can be achieved in either of two ways:

* *Top-down approach*: This is the direct fall-out of the recursive formulation of any problem. If the solution to any problem can be formulated recursively using the solution to its sub-problems, and if its sub-problems are overlapping, then one can easily memoize or store the solutions to the sub-problems in a table. Whenever we attempt to solve a new sub-problem, we first check the table to see if it is already solved. If a solution has been recorded, we can use it directly, otherwise we solve the sub-problem and add its solution to the table. This is referred to as **Memoization**.

* *Bottom-up approach*: Once we formulate the solution to a problem recursively as in terms of its sub-problems, we can try reformulating the problem in a bottom-up fashion: try solving the sub-problems first and use their solutions to build-on and arrive at solutions to bigger sub-problems. This is also usually done in a tabular form by iteratively generating solutions to bigger and bigger sub-problems by using the solutions to small sub-problems. This is referred to as **Dynamic Programming** (in the narrow sense).

## Example: Computing Fibonacci Number

### Naive recursive implementation: O(2^n) time, O(2^n) space

The first step to apply dynamic programming to identify the recurrence structure of the problem and write down the recursive solution. You'll then need to analyze whether there are overlapping sub-problems. Here, we produce a call tree that calls the function on the same value many different times.

```c++
int fib(int n) {
    if n <= 1 return n;
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
}
```

### Top-down approach (memoization): O(n) time, O(n) space

We use a map to retain all intermediate results through the entire computation, and proceed in a top-down way.

Aside: Why memoization instead of memo**R**ization? See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45242851/why-memoization-instead-of-memorization).

```c++
int helper(int n, unordered_map<int, int>& mem) {
    if n <= 1 return n;
    if (mem.find(n) != m.end()) return mem[n];
    return helper(n - 1) + helper(n - 2);
}

int fib(int n) {
    unordered_map<int, int> mem;
    return helper(n, mem);
}
```

### Bottom-up approach: O(n) time, O(n) space

We use an array to retain all intermediate results through the entire computation, and proceed in a bottom-up way.

```c++
int fib(int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    vector<int> mem(n);
    mem[0] = 0;
    mem[1] = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
        mem[i] = mem[i - 1] + mem[i - 2];
    }
    return mem[n];
}
```

### Bottom-up approach, space optimized: O(n) time, O(1) space

In many dynamic programming algorithms, it is not necessary to retain all intermediate results through the entire computation. Here, we can significantly reduce the space requirements of our algorithm by maintaining only the two newest elements of the array. More generally, if the solution to a problem of size n depends on its f(n) sub-problems, then at least O(f(n)) auxiliary space is needed by reusing memoization space.

```c++
int fib(int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    int prev = 0;
    int curr = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        int temp = prev + curr;
        prev = curr;
        curr = temp;
    }
    return curr;
}
```

## Steps for Solving Problems with Dynamic Programming

(Adapted from Chp 3.4, [Algorithms by Jeff Erickson](https://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/))

### First, formulate the problem recursively

* What's the **problem, in a exact way**?
* What's the **base case**?
* What's the **recursive step**?
  
### Next, build solutions to your recurrence from the bottom up

* **Identify the subproblems**.
* **Choose a memoization data structure**. Find a data structure that can
store the solution to every subproblem you identified. This is usually, but not always, a multidimensional array.
* **Identify dependencies**. Except for the base cases, every subproblem
depends on other subproblems. It's better to draw a picture with arrows between subproblems to represent the dependencies.
* **Find a good evaluation order**. Order the subproblems so that each one
comes after the subproblems it depends on. The dependencies you identified in the previous step define a partial order over the subproblems; you need to find a linear extension of that partial order (a.k.a., do topological sorting over the dependency graph).
* **(Optional) Find possible ways to reuse memoization space**. In many dynamic programming algorithms, it is not necessary to retain all intermediate results through the entire computation. More generally, if the solution to a problem of size n depends on its f(n) sub-problems, then at least O(f(n)) auxiliary space is needed by reusing memoization space.
* **Analyze space and running time**. The number of distinct subproblems
determines the space complexity of your memoized algorithm (without space reusing). To compute the total running time, add up the running times of all possible subproblems, assuming deeper recursive calls are already memoized.
* **Write down the algorithm**. Finally! Usually a couple of nested loops.
